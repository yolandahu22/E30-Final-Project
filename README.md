# E30-Final-Project
## Developing a Mirrorless Camera Attachment for Lensless Imaging

#### For our project, we want to implement a variation of the DiffuserCam using an off-the-shelf mirrorless camera. Since most of the existing research in the field approaches lensless imaging with image sensors, we want to adapt the existing designs and algorithms to make a commercial camera capable of doing 3D image reconstruction.
