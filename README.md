# E30-Final-Project
## Developing a Mirrorless Camera Attachment for Lensless Imaging

For our project, we want to implement a variation of the DiffuserCam using an off-the-shelf mirrorless camera. Since most of the existing research in the field approaches lensless imaging with image sensors, we want to adapt the existing designs and algorithms to make a commercial camera capable of doing 3D image reconstruction. 

### Contents

The "3D Files" folder contains the reproduced original MATLAB code for DiffuserCam 3D reconstruction. Key files include `DiffuserCam_settings.m` and `DiffuserCam_main.m`. The "3d_example_data" folder contains Waller Lab's test data for these programs. 

"Images" contains all of the Raw data and PSFs from the camera attachment. While both .JPG and .RAF are included, we primarily used .RAF (due to JPEG nonlinearity complexities).
