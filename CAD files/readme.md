All files are in .step format, which can be modified in most 3D parametric modelling software. Fusion 360 was used for these designs. 

diffuser.step: experimental diffuser design made of 4mm spheres
flashlightstandv1.step: stand for an olight with a pinhole aperture, to allow it to act as a point source for finding PSFs. 
XmountDiffuserAttachment.step: Diffuser attachment for a FujiFilm X-T10 (should work with any similar mirrorless model). Based on the X-mount design reference found at https://grabcad.com/library/fujifilm-x-mount-design-reference-1
